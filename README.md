Getting familiar with GitHub

Hi,
Just getting started with coding on Codecademy and freeCodeCamp. I've jumped into the basics with html and css and will be expirementing with some website designing and hopefully working on app concepts in the future. At this point I am enjoying learning, so we'll see how far I delve into it. Any advice or suggestions are appreciated!
